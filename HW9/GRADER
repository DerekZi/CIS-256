Part II
First, we need to mark all walls to be true. Then, choose a random starting cell, visit the cell, and mark it visited.
Then, we use a loop to go through those walls which are still true and those cells that are still unvisited.

(a) After visting a cell and marking it, we can make sure that there is no cycle. This ensures there is no more than one path between any pair of cells.
(b) Because we randomly choose a starting cell and a direction that the Depth-First Search goes through, the algorithm uses random numbers to generate a different maze
