    #1 quick sort because from the histogram, we can see the process of dividing and sorting happen at the same time 
    #2 selection sort because from the histogram, we can see the process of removing a smallest item from the unsorted portion of the array and appending it to the end of the sorted portion of the array
    #3 mergesort because from the histogram, we can see the process of dividing at first, sorting, merging at the end.
    #4 insertionsort  because from the histogram, we can see the process of inserting item in unsorted portion of the array into sorted portion of the array
    
    quicksort is the fastest on random data
    insertionsort is the fastest on presorted data
    Mergesort is the fastest on reverse sorted data

    the first integer in the array is the pivot from the histogram of quick sort for presorted array, we can see that the array is always partitioned by the first integer of the array.
